# Snake Game

A simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using the Turtle module from Python. The game features a snake that grows as it eats food, and the player must avoid colliding with the walls or the snake itself. Inspired by the classic arcade game.

```

## Gameplay

- Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
- Eat the food (represented by a circle) to grow the snake and increase your score.
- Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.
- The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the boundaries.
