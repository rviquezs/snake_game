# Snake Game

A simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using the Turtle module from Python. The game features a snake that grows as it eats food, and the player must avoid colliding with the walls or the snake itself. Inspired by the classic arcade game.

## Installation

1. **Download the Project Files**
   - Download the ZIP file of the project from [this link](https://github.com/rvqzs/snake_game/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).

2. **Extract the ZIP File**
   - After downloading, extract the ZIP file to a directory of your choice. This will create a folder named `snake_game-master` containing the project files.

3. **Check Python Installation**
   - To check if Python is installed on your system, open a terminal or command prompt and run:
     ```bash
     python --version
     ```
   - If Python is not installed, download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Ensure you download Python version 3.11.8 or above.

4. **Install Turtle Module**
   - The Turtle module is included with most Python distributions. If it's not installed, you can install it via pip:
     ```bash
     pip install PythonTurtle
     ```

## Usage

1. **Open Terminal or PowerShell**
   - On Windows, you can open Command Prompt or PowerShell by pressing `Win + R`, typing `cmd` or `powershell`, and pressing `Enter`.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   - Use the `cd` command to change to the directory where you extracted the ZIP file. For example, if you extracted the files to `C:\Users\username\Downloads\snake_game-master`, you would run:
     ```bash
     cd C:\Users\username\Downloads\snake_game-master
     ```

3. **Run the Game**
   - Start the game by running the following command:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```
   - If you encounter issues, try:
     ```bash
     py main.py
     ```

4. **Start Playing**
   - Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
   - Eat the food (represented by a circle) to grow the snake and increase your score.
   - Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.
   - The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the boundaries.
